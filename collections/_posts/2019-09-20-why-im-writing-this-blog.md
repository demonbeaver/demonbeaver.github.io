## Writing sucks
It's true. I hate it.

There are professions where writing is the major skill to master in order to succeed. I'm thinking law or journalism. People who work in these fields train every day in the ability to distill their thoughts into text, making it clear, compelling, convincing.

Then there are other jobs - like mine - where writing is necessary, but by no means the main ability required to succeed. I've seen scores of researchers or software developers who, while being very competent at what they do, can't write properly and it shows. It shows in their reports, in their documentation.

And so we reach the purpose of this blog. I don't like writing and am pretty bad at it. But like any other skill, training is key. And, in my opinion, writing, like other "soft" skills in security, such as debating, presenting or (avoiding) office politics, is necessary and part of being a proper professional. So, whether I like it or not, I should write more, especially concerning professional, technical matters. That's what this site is for.

## The Site
I chose [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.io) for this blog. Not necessarily the best platform for a blog, but very fitting for my goal:
- It is relatively bare-bones. I have to do the design by myself. Since I don't know the first thing about web design and the existing front-ends, this is very educational. Here I should put a quick Thank You to [David Darnes](https://darn.es/) and his [Alembic Theme](https://alembic.darn.es/). I used it to get going quickly. As of writing, this site is a hacky version of the theme.
- It is very transparent: everything I do with this site is visible within the [public repository](https://www.github.com/demonbeaver/demonbeaver.github.io) of this site. This both forces me to be cautious about how I manage the page (nothing more embarassing than being a security professional whose site has been hacked) and opens me up to feedback not only relating to content, but also implementation.
- It is built to be associated with open source development. I hope, within time, to publish some of my code on GitHub. When that happens, this blog can parallel as a development blog, where I share information on the projects and the process that brought them into existence.

## The Plan
My goal is as following: Write lots. Write often. Publish first, edit later. Get better at expressing my insights and opinions. Get feedback from people with skills better than mine. Improve.

If, in the end, it's all a bunch of useless trash that sounds like a high schooler who is really into Hunter S. Thompson, I can always delete it as failed project. It will still have given me more writing training.

Any feedback is welcome. Here (once I figure out how to add comment sections) or through any other channel.

Now I'll go back to writing something relevant to the subject of this blog. I hope to publish it soon!
